# -Ship_Trajecctory_Simulator_by_Nomoto_Model
I developed this code while doing my undergraduate thesis titled, "Probabilistic Analysis of Grounding near the Waterway of Rampal Power Plant in Bangladesh for Random ship-speeds". 
It uses "Runge-Kutta 2nd Order Method" to solve "Nomoto Model", which is a governing equation for ship maneuvering.
After that, it plots the result with the help of "Matplotlib" on a particular river-bend of Poshur River that is situated close to Sundarbans.
